# Geometry Dash (1.710) Decompilation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a **work-in-progress** decompilation of Geometry Dash version 1.710. Some of the core functionality is implemented, but not enough for it to be in a usable state.

# Why decompile 1.7?

- It uses cocos2d-x 2.2.3 (the older version GD used has broken screen orientations)
- It does not have slopes
- SimpleAudioEngine is used as the audio engine (instead of FMOD which is used in current versions)

# Building

### 1. Get the source code

Before anything you're going to need to install [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/) onto your computer.

After you've done that, you can simply run the following line on your computer's terminal application: 
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/aloaf812/cocos2d-x
```

What this does is it clones the *cocos2d-x* fork **recursively** so that both *cocos2d-x* and the *GD* repository are downloaded and set up.

### 2. Compiling the code
